# stakater-operator-boilerplate
Boilerplate project for kick-starting your operator development

## Description
For effective development of operator. 
This project includes some common utils to handle reconciliation and caching.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes/Openshift cluster to run against.
### Running locally
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```
2. Login to your development cluster, preferably CRC or SNO
3. Run the operator
```sh
make install run
```

### Running on the cluster with OLM
1. Add semver using `VERSION` variable in `MakeFile`:

```sh
VERSION?= x.x.x eg 0.1.0
```

2. Specify docker repo baseURL by modifying `IMAGE_TAG_BASE` variable in `MakeFile`:

3. Build and push all images:

```sh
make publish
```
4. Modify `catalog.yaml` and `subscription.yaml` with the same `VERSION` in `MakeFile`.
```sh
kind: CatalogSource
spec:
  image: stakaterdockerhubpullroot/stakater-operator-boilerplate-catalog:v{VERSION}
  
kind: Subscription
spec:
  startingCSV: stakater-operator-boilerplate.v{VERSION}
```

4. Deploy the `catalogs` and `subscription` manifests.
```sh
oc apply -f misc/olm
```
